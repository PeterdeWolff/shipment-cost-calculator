Readme file for the Website shipment Calculator.

Below you will find a description of the website for the shipment calculator built for the Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project of the Code Institute full stack developer program.
The site can be visited using the URL:  https://github.com/PeterdeWolff/.....

Nowadays there are many options for sending your goods all around the globe. Sometimes it can be complicated to find the rates for your shipment. Rates are depending on destination (country), volume and weight.
To make your decision a bit more easy this website will give you an estimation of the shipment costs within Europe based on 3 variables.  These three variables are:  Destination (= country), size ( = volume) and weight. 
The main goal of the website is to give the user a estimation of costs for sending the goods. 
On the other hand we can make reports giving information about countries we ship most too, average weight and costs of our shipments.

Business goals of this website are:
-	Provide costs for shipment
-	Showing what forwarder to use (future)
-	Report on requested destination, costs and weight


UX
Visitors of the website are  employees searching for cost information concerning shipments. The people that are questioned all knew that the website does only offer rates for European countries.


User experience client stories are:
